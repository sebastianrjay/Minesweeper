This is a JavaScript re-implementation of Microsoft's classic computer game,
Minesweeper.

Features:

- Uses no external JavaScript libraries; relies instead on a purpose-built, 
streamlined implementation of jQuery that leverages JavaScript's modern DOM 
functionality to trim off ~9000 lines of code.
- Gameplay features animations and sound effects.
