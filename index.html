      <p>Welcome to Minesweeper. Click on a square with the left mouse button to
        reveal it, and some of its non-mined neighbors. If there is a number on
        the square, the number reveals the number of its immediately adjacent
        neighbors that are mined. If you suspect that a square is mined, right
        click on it to flag it. To win, reveal all squares without ever clicking
        on a mined square.
