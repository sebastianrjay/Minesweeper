      <p>Welcome to Minesweeper. Click on a square to reveal it, and some of its
        non-mined neighbors. If there is a number on the square, the number
        reveals the number of its immediately adjacent neighbors that are mined.
        To win, reveal all squares without ever clicking on a mined square.
