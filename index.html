      <p>Welcome to Minesweeper. Click on a square with the left mouse button to
        reveal it, and its non-mined neighbors. If there is a number on the 
        square, the number reveals the number of its immediately adjacent
        neighbors that are mined. If you suspect that a square is mined, right
        click on it to flag it. Right click on it again to un-flag it, if
        desired. To win, flag all 12 of the mined squares without flagging any 
        non-mined squares.</p>
